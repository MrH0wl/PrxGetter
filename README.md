# PrxGetter
This is a tool to scrape (from httptunnel . ge) and check the scraped proxies.
NOTES:
"PrxGetterFor2" is for Python2 users and "PrxGetterFor3" is for Python3 users.

USAGE:
Just run the script according to your Python version, the output will be named "outputxxxxx" ("xxxxx" is because they are all random numbers) and all of the live proxies will be saved there.

Thanks.
